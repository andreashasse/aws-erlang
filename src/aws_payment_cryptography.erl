%% @doc Creates an alias, or a friendly name, for an Amazon Web Services
%% Payment Cryptography key.
%%
%% You can use an alias to identify a key in the console and when you call
%% cryptographic operations such as EncryptData or DecryptData.
%%
%% You can associate the alias with any key in the same Amazon Web Services
%% Region. Each alias is associated with only one key at a time, but a key
%% can have multiple aliases. You can't create an alias without a key.
%% The alias must be unique in the account and Amazon Web Services Region,
%% but you can create another alias with the same name in a different Amazon
%% Web Services Region.
%%
%% To change the key that's associated with the alias, call
%% `UpdateAlias'. To delete the alias, call `DeleteAlias'. These
%% operations don't affect the underlying key. To get the alias that you
%% created, call `ListAliases'.

%% @doc Creates an Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography key, a logical
%% representation of a cryptographic key, that is unique in your account and
%% Amazon Web Services Region.
%%
%% You use keys for cryptographic functions such as encryption and
%% decryption.
%%
%% In addition to the key material used in cryptographic operations, an
%% Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography key includes metadata such as the
%% key ARN, key usage, key origin, creation date, description, and key state.
%%
%% When you create a key, you specify both immutable and mutable data about
%% the key. The immutable data contains key attributes that defines the scope
%% and cryptographic operations that you can perform using the key, for
%% example key class (example: `SYMMETRIC_KEY'), key algorithm (example:
%% `TDES_2KEY'), key usage (example: `TR31_P0_PIN_ENCRYPTION_KEY')
%% and key modes of use (example: `Encrypt'). For information about valid
%% combinations of key attributes, see Understanding key attributes in the
%% Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide. The mutable data
%% contained within a key includes usage timestamp and key deletion timestamp
%% and can be modified after creation.
%%
%% Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography binds key attributes to keys
%% using key blocks when you store or export them. Amazon Web Services
%% Payment Cryptography stores the key contents wrapped and never stores or
%% transmits them in the clear.

%% @doc Deletes the key material and all metadata associated with Amazon Web
%% Services Payment Cryptography key.
%%
%% Key deletion is irreversible. After a key is deleted, you can't
%% perform cryptographic operations using the key. For example, you can't
%% decrypt data that was encrypted by a deleted Amazon Web Services Payment
%% Cryptography key, and the data may become unrecoverable. Because key
%% deletion is destructive, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography has a
%% safety mechanism to prevent accidental deletion of a key. When you call
%% this operation, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography disables the
%% specified key but doesn't delete it until after a waiting period. The
%% default waiting period is 7 days. To set a different waiting period, set
%% `DeleteKeyInDays'. During the waiting period, the `KeyState' is
%% `DELETE_PENDING'. After the key is deleted, the `KeyState' is
%% `DELETE_COMPLETE'.
%%
%% If you delete key material, you can use `ImportKey' to reimport the
%% same key material into the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography key.
%%
%% You should delete a key only when you are sure that you don't need to
%% use it anymore and no other parties are utilizing this key. If you
%% aren't sure, consider deactivating it instead by calling
%% `StopKeyUsage'.

%% @doc Exports a key from Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography using

%%
%% Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography simplifies main or root key
%% exchange process by eliminating the need of a paper-based key exchange
%% process. It takes a modern and secure approach based of the ANSI X9 TR-34
%% key exchange standard.
%%
%% You can use `ExportKey' to export main or root keys such as KEK (Key
%% Encryption Key), using asymmetric key exchange technique following ANSI X9
%% TR-34 standard. The ANSI X9 TR-34 standard uses asymmetric keys to
%% establishes bi-directional trust between the two parties exchanging keys.
%% After which you can export working keys using the ANSI X9 TR-31 symmetric
%% key exchange standard as mandated by PCI PIN. Using this operation, you
%% can share your Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography generated keys
%% with other service partners to perform cryptographic operations outside of
%% Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography
%%
%% TR-34 key export
%%
%% Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography uses TR-34 asymmetric key
%% exchange standard to export main keys such as KEK. In TR-34 terminology,
%% the sending party of the key is called Key Distribution Host (KDH) and the
%% receiving party of the key is called Key Receiving Host (KRH). In key
%% export process, KDH is Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography which
%% initiates key export. KRH is the user receiving the key. Before you
%% initiate TR-34 key export, you must obtain an export token by calling
%% `GetParametersForExport'. This operation also returns the signing key
%% certificate that KDH uses to sign the wrapped key to generate a TR-34
%% wrapped key block. The export token expires after 7 days.
%%
%% Set the following parameters:
%%
%% <dl> <dt>CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier</dt> <dd> The
%% `KeyARN' of the certificate chain that will sign the wrapping key
%% certificate. This must exist within Amazon Web Services Payment
%% Cryptography before you initiate TR-34 key export. If it does not exist,
%% you can import it by calling `ImportKey' for
%% `RootCertificatePublicKey'.
%%
%% </dd> <dt>ExportToken</dt> <dd> Obtained from KDH by calling
%% `GetParametersForExport'.
%%
%% </dd> <dt>WrappingKeyCertificate</dt> <dd> Amazon Web Services Payment
%% Cryptography uses this to wrap the key under export.
%%
%% </dd> </dl> When this operation is successful, Amazon Web Services Payment
%% Cryptography returns the TR-34 wrapped key block.
%%
%% TR-31 key export
%%
%% Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography uses TR-31 symmetric key exchange
%% standard to export working keys. In TR-31, you must use a main key such as
%% KEK to encrypt or wrap the key under export. To establish a KEK, you can
%% use `CreateKey' or `ImportKey'. When this operation is successful,
%% Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography returns a TR-31 wrapped key
%% block.

%% @doc Adds or edits tags on an Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography
%% key.
%%
%% Tagging or untagging an Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography key can
%% allow or deny permission to the key.
%%
%% Each tag consists of a tag key and a tag value, both of which are
%% case-sensitive strings. The tag value can be an empty (null) string. To
%% add a tag, specify a new tag key and a tag value. To edit a tag, specify
%% an existing tag key and a new tag value. You can also add tags to an
%% Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography key when you create it with
%% `CreateKey'.
